Iâ€™m Anna Leung, a doctoral candidate at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, with a background as a Chinese language teacher in Hong Kong schools. My research focuses on understanding the causes and subtypes of developmental dyslexia, psychometrics in psycholinguistics, and the cognitive processes involved in reading.

In addition to my research, I offer tailored public speaking training for academic contexts, empowering individuals of all ages to communicate with confidence and clarity.
