Iâ€™m Anna Leung, a researcher in psycholinguistics at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, formerly a Chinese language teacher in Hong Kong schools. 

My research focuses on understanding the causes and subtypes of developmental dyslexia, psychometrics in psycholinguistics, and cognition in reading.

I also offer tailored public speaking training for academic contexts, empowering individuals of all ages to communicate with confidence and clarity.
