### Advancing Excellence in Chinese Language Education
As a dedicated educator, I bring over nine years of teaching experience in Hong Kong, specialising in Chinese Language education across primary and secondary school curricula. With a B.Ed. in Chinese Language (First Class Honours) from The Education University of Hong Kong, I have combined academic rigour with practical expertise, earning recognition for my research on linguistics and reading assessment. My experience extends beyond the classroom, including contributions as a freelance Chinese textbook editor for Chinese language curricula in Hong Kong.

### Guiding Graduate Research to Global Stages
I have valuable experience teaching in tertiary education, particularly in the field of psychology and learning sciences. Worked as a Research Seminar Instructor at Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, I designed and delivered research seminars, guiding graduate students in developing their research and critical thinking skills. Many of my students have presented their work at prestigious international conferences. My teaching philosophy emphasises fostering independent inquiry, academic excellence, and meaningful contributions to the research community.

### Public Speaking Training Tailored to Your Needs
My public speaking journey began during my school years, where I received extensive training and served as a student leader, coaching solo and choral speech teams. These teams achieved championships in the highly competitive Hong Kong Speech Festivals, fostering my passion for speech and communication. Since then, I have applied these skills to my professional teaching and academic work.

From 2012 to 2019, I worked as a Public Speaking Tutor at renowned primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong, including Belilios Public School and Shun Lee Catholic Secondary School. During this time, I guided students in developing effective communication skills, leading them to achieve top honours in prestigious public speaking competitions.

Since 2021, I have been volunteering as a public speaking trainer, providing tailored advice to researchers of all levels in humanities and social sciences across global institutions. My training focuses on enhancing conference presentations, including delivering impactful talks in English, Cantonese, and Mandarin Chinese, with expertise in advanced visualisation techniques and theatrical speaking skills.

If you are interested in workshops, teaching courses, or personalised training to enhance public speaking and presentation skills, please feel free to reach out to me for tailored guidance designed to meet your unique goals and needs.
